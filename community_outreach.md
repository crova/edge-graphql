# Elixir Community outreach strategy
#### To raise awareness about the sample repo, the article, and fly, the following actions would take place:
* [Post on Elixir Forum official Blog Post thread](https://elixirforum.com/tag/official-blog-posts-thread)
* [Message on Elixir discord server under the #share channel](https://discord.com/channels/269508806759809042/584471648187449352)
* [Reddit elixir section](reddit.com/r/elixir/)
* Talk about it on Absinthe's slack channel
* For all of the above, be alert for any questions/comments to follow up and keep engaging. All of the above represent a constant stream to broadcast the latest articles we come up with.
* Twitter will be handled with a post on (https://elixirstatus.com/) that is broadcasted by its Twitter handle and other feeds. Best bang for our buck twitter-wise.
* Reach out to Elixir Wizards Podcast (https://smartlogic.io/podcast/elixir-wizards/). The current season is named `Adopting Elixir` and they might be interested in hearing from Fly and its Elixir endeavor.
